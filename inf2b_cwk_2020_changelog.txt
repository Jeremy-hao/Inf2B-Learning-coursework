02/04/2020 0.9.4 -> 0.9.5
 - Submission deadline:
    10/04/2020 -> 14/04/2020
 - Task 2.3:
    Changed the class of the periphery of Polygon_A from Class 1 to
    Class 0, so that only the inside of polygon corresponds to Class 1.
 - Task 2.6:
    "A and B denote the inside and periphery of corresponding polygon"  --> "A and B denote the inside of corresponding polygon"

30/03/2020 0.9.3 -> 0.9.4
 - Section 1, 2nd paragraph:
   "using the electronic submission command" --> "using the electronic submission via Learn"
 - Task 2.4:
    Added "we assume D=2 hereafter" to clarify the size of X for task2_hNN_A(X).
    (NB: this also applies to task2_hNN_AB(X) and task2_sNN_AB(X).) 
 - Section 5 Submission:
    Update the instructions to reflect the change of submission method
    from the submit command to Learn. Please see the latest handout for details.

24/03/2020 0.9.2 -> 0.9.3
 - Task 1.3 (c):
    Clarified that there is no need to submit a code file for this part (c).
 - Task 1.4:
    Clarified that the covariance matrices to save are the ones that
    the regularisation has been applied to.
 - Task 2:
    Amended the descriptions about the order of vertices in the polygon
    definition file. The correct information is that vertices are shown
    in anti-clockwise order for Polygon_A, and in clockwise order for Polygon_B.
 - Task 2.1:
    Modified the last paragraph:
     "this function can take" --> "this function should be capable of taking"

20/03/2020 0.9 -> 0.9.2
 - Submission date in the front page:
	Updated to reflect the school-wide extension of coursework
 - Section 1:
	Added a directory path to code templates
 - In Tasks 1.1 and 1.3:
 	Clarify the specifications of variables.
 - In Task 1.1 (b):
	Modified: 'function Task1_1(X, Y)' --> 'Task1_1(X, y);'
 - In Task 1.3:
 	Clarified the meaning of cumulative variance.
 - In Task 2, first paragraph:
	Clarified the order of vertices (which is clockwise order) in the polygon specification file.
 - In Task 2.4:
 	Fixed typo: Task 3.1 --> Task 2.1
 - In Task 2.6:
	Corrected the classification rule, as the original one was wrong.
 	(Please see the updated version)
 - In Task 2.7:
 	Fixed typo: t2_plot_regions_hNN_AB.m --> task2_plot_regions_hNN_AB.m
 - In Section 4:
	 Added 'corr()' to the list of forbidden functions. 
 - In Section 5:
	 Added a description so that submission via Learn is acceptable
	 if submit command is not available.
